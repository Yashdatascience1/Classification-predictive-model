# Classification-predictive-model
## Business objective
An aviation company that provides domestic as well as international trips to the customers now wants to apply a targeted approach 
instead of reaching out to each of the customers. This time they want to do it digitally instead of tele calling. 
Hence they have collaborated with a social networking platform, so they can learn the digital and social behaviour of the customers 
and provide the digital advertisement on the user page of the targeted customers who have a high propensity to take up the product.

My objective was to build a predictive model which accurately helps the company identify who will buy from them.

The dataset and the code files have been uploaded in this repository. One can [click here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r8MLB2-l8UgDOsztc3dgVBKUlUw3de9p?usp=sharing) to view the code file.
